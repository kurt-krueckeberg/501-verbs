I think verbs-2-conjugate.txt contins only the essentail verbs that are strong or irregular. Any related prefix verbs that might be in must-conjugate.php
will not be found in verbs-2-conjugate.txt  It is really the list to use.

What info from results.txt do I want as flashcards?

I. Definitions of all verbs, including prefix verbs, and Conjugations (of only strong and irregular verbs).

 create-conjugated.php creates verbs-2-conjugate.txt.

- I want the definition in a consistent, simple form like that in verbs.txt. Use either the definition in the index, which are one word; or make the results.txt
  definitions consistent and simpler.

II.
  Cloze samples sentences with translations.

- I want the sample sentences as cloze sentences in which the verb is replaced with ___________, and the translation of the sentence is in parentheses after 
  the German sentence. An the answer is the German verb correctly conjugated.
