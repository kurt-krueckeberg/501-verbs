This uses a github library for converting PDF to text called smalot/pdfparser. See composer.json.
You must therefore run 'composer' first in order to install the library.

Then do:

php -f code.php
php -f rewrite-output.php

The output will be in two files:
1. results-nonessential-verbs.txt
2. results-essential-verbs.txt
