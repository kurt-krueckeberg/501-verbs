counts.txt has the count of "Examples:" and "EXAMPLES".
verbs.txt seems to have all the verbs because the total lines in verbs.txt corresponds to the sum of counts in counts.txt.

Design.

After advacing to "Page 32", ...
Loop until eof:

1. Call fetch_page() and look with in the page for:
    - first the inifinitive, which will be on the first line of the page-string.
    - Starting at the next by "Principle Parts:"
2. Look for "^Examples:"
   If found retrieve the example sentences, if not found, then the example sentences are on the next page following "^Examples\s*$". 
3. Get page number from the line with the regex: '^7_9393_501German_FM1  8\/28\/07  3:31 PM  Page 32'
4. If examples on next page:
   - fetch_page()
   - Get EXAMPLES 

TODO:
* Manually add a terminator to the 55 or 66 EXAMPLES sentences blocks.
* Manually add the remaining missing Z verbs to verbs.txt.
