Some/many of the prefix verb sample sentences are not paired with the correct verb. They are paried with a subsequent prfix verb. For example, abarbeiten is on the line
with a different/later arbeiten prefix verb.

It seems prefix verbs can have "/^Examples:$/" instead of--or in addtion, too--"/^EXAMPLES$/". Arbeiten is the first such example.
